				We are happy to announce that "DEMO" Hospitals, one of the most trusted name in healthcare is back on its growth track again. We are in the process of introducing sweeping changes to infuse new vigour into the Group. "DEMO" today ensures better goalposts, improved trust, clarity of vision and faster business and strategic decisions. In keeping with the Group's ethos of providing best quality services at competitive rates, "DEMO" Hospitals today is managed by professionals of a high order.
				<br><br>
				We have started business process re-engineering with the focus on the group concept rather than individual unit concept. Now each unit has to follow the group SOPs, which are being chalked out keeping patient safety and quality in mind. HR Department is focusing more on talent acquisition and management.
				<br><br>
				We are in the phase of consolidation and stabilization of our existing projects. We have started our 400 bed Bhubaneswar unit in Orissa, located on the Khandagiri bypass to fill the void of super specialty highly advanced healthcare facility in the State of Odisha. We have an ambitious plan of investing Rs. 1,000 crore in the next five years. We are striding ahead to break new grounds and position "DEMO" Group as one of the fastest growing healthcare players of eastern India.
				<br><br>
				I wish you all health and happiness.
