Clinical laboratory in a Hospital setting showing several automated analysers.
A medical laboratory or clinical laboratory <br>is a laboratory where tests are done on clinical specimens in order to obtain information about the health of a patient.</p>

		<p id="header-text-content"> Clinical laboratories are thus focused on applied science, mainly on a production-like basis, as opposed to research laboratories that focus on basic science on an academic basis. Medical laboratories vary in size and so offer a variety of testing services.Many specimens end up in one or more sophisticated automated analysers, that process a fraction of the sample to return one or more test results. Some laboratories use robotic sample handlers (Laboratory automation) to optimize the workflow and reduce the risk of contamination from sample handling by the staff. </p>

		<p id="subject">In hospitals and other patient-care settings, laboratory medicine is performed by the Department of Pathology, and generally divided into two sections, each of which will be subdivided into multiple specialty areas. Some of the laboratory include:<br><br>

		While blood collection is a fundamental part of our organization's purpose, providing safe blood products to hospitals, andultimately patients in need, is our primary goal. The hallmarks of our services are rapid turnaround coupled with expert diagnostic, consultative, and educational support for patients and physicians. By working closely with our health care provider partners to establish standards for transfusion decisions, we ensure that all patients receive the proper type and dosage of transfusion products.

			&#8226  Anatomic pathology: areas included here are histopathology, cytopathology, and electron microscopy. <br>
			&#8226  Clinical Microbiology: This encompasses several different sciences. These include bacteriology, virology, parasitology, immunology, and mycology.<br>
			&#8226  Clinical Chemistry: This area typically includes automated analysis of blood specimens, enzymology, toxicology and endocrinology.<br>
			&#8226  Hematology: This area includes automated and manual analysis of blood cells. It also often includes coagulation.<br>
			&#8226  Blood Bank involves the testing of blood specimens in order to provide transfusion and related services.<br>
			&#8226  Genetics testing may be done, along with a subspecialty known as cytogenetics.<br>
			&#8226  Reproductive biology testing is available in some laboratories, including Semen analysis, Sperm bank and assisted reproductive technology.<br>
